# This Weeks Homework

1. For this weeks homework cycle, I started out only ok. I kept getting confused when watching the tutorial videos explaining what classes and methods etc were. I don't even think I did the week 7 discussion correctly. I might have on one of them, but definitely not both. Not very confident in that.
2. I met with someone from my study group and we went over what she had done already for this week's homework. At that point I hadn't done anything yet, and she had already started building something from scratch so I wanted to see. It wasn't far off from what the hw 7 example was, so I thought I would be able to do it without much trouble.
3. The problems were off and on this week. I couldn't figure out why none of my styles were working, then I found out I was using .whatever instead of #whatever since I was using ID's instead of class with each div tag. I also had a problem where I forgot to put scripts/main.js and only put main.js so my stuff wasn't going to the next screen. One of my friends was able to help me with that real quick to fix it. Then other problems I had were just little hiccups in the road, but I was able to solve them.
4. Honestly I didn't know how I was supposed to make a "viewfinder" for this weeks assignment. I was close, but I guess my brain wasn't connecting how this assignment could be a viewfinder. So I waited until someone else was done with their code, then saw the example of what it should look like, and went from there. That actually really helped because as soon as I saw it, I realized what I needed to do, and went for it.
5. I didn't help anyone with problems this week. Compared to last week, it seemed a bit easier so I don't think many people needed help.

## Additional Info

- Grasshopper is still going well! Really enjoying it.
- At first I couldn't figure out the random part, then realized I could go back to hw5 and see how we established randomness in there, and input that into this weeks homework (and it worked).
