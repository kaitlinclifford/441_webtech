# This Weeks Homework

1. For this weeks homework cycle, I'm not going to lie, I had a hard time actually sitting down and going through all of the material. I had a big project due in 440, and so most of my time was taken up by finishing that. But when I finally got around to doing the readings, it mostly made sense to me. I don't know if I just think it's super simple, or if it actually is, but I really like JQuery because of the easy nature to do things in it.
2. I really need to stop procrastinating. The weeks are getting harder, and I want more time to do my homework and make it look nice, so I'm going to try and start it earlier. Hopefully soon I'll find time to be able to join a live session too.
3. There didn't seem to be too many problems this week. My main one was figuring out how to animate the squares but I got it.
4. Each week I like to go to different peoples sites and see what they've created, and this week I saw Christoff's and I got really overwhelmed because his was so good. I knew I wasn't going to be able to make that good of a site this week, so I just tried my best to make it look nice. I feel like that level of stuff he did in ranking different movies and scrolling through them is the level I want to get to by the end of this class.
5. I didn't help anyone with problems this week. My email doesn't like to update all the time, so I didn't see any of the issues until after they were mostly solved.
