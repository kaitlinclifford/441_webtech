# This Weeks Homework

1. For this weeks homework cycle, it was super easy to understand at first when I was watching the videos, but when it came to doing things on my own, I got very lost and confused and couldn't figure out where certain things went... I had a rough start to this assignment. I realized I might have been doing it wrong last week so I tried to change it up. I don't think it's exactly what I envisioned but it's close. I wanted to change the background image when someone typed a certain word, but I couldn't make it work. I'll look for solutions online to try and see if I can figure it out.
2. In order to complete the assignment I watched every video that there was and even went back to last weeks stuff to look at code and watch videos too. I wanted to make sure I really understood everything that was being presented to me, but I still don't understand everything. I don't want to fall behind so I'm trying as best as I can to keep up.
3. The problems kept adding up just like last week. I couldn't figure out how to make a background image, even after searching and searching. Finally I went to one of my friends code and was able to see how they did it. Also, the popups kept giving me trouble. I didn't understand how to fix it asking a question when you're supposed to have "quit" the story.
4. Oh my gosh! There were many times this week were my brain just hit a wall and didn't want to learn or help me figure out a problem. That was the main reason I had to ask for help for the getElementById since I didn't understand how to use that at all.
5. I didn't help anyone this week with issues because I was already having too many problems for myself to be able to help others.

## Additional Info

- Grasshopper is going well... haven't used the code academy since the first time because I enjoy Grasshopper a lot better!
- After watching the tutorial with example code we could use, I still wanted to use popup prompts because I had already worked so hard on them, but still wanted to try and incorporate some of the techniques that were in the example.
