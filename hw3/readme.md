# This Weeks Homework

1. For this weeks homework cycle, I felt it to be really easy to understand but when I went and tried to make my own site, it was harder than I realized. I had to switch up what I wanted to do for the adventure every now and then in order to actually make the site work. It's not exactly what I wanted, but since we're continuing with it next week, I think I can make it a bit better.
2. In order to complete the assignment I followed the links, and followed along with the video. Then when I was making my code, I started to code it, and go back through the examples and past homework to see if I had done it the correct way.
3. The problems kept adding up this week. Honestly I didn't know if I was doing the assignment right, but just went with it anyway. I know that it's going to be a "choose your own adventure story" type of deal, but I still hope I am off to the right start. If not, I'll fix it.
4. I felt like I understood most of the terminology that was being talked about, so it was easy enough for me to follow along without getting lost. The only issues I had was when I actually went to do the homework by myself and it seemed like everything I had learned just left my brain!
5. I didn't help anyone this week with issues because there was no one who had issues that I saw.

## Additional Info

- I had a good time using Grasshopper. I really enjoy it. I just wish it went into more detail and gave you even more examples for each part that you're learning so that you could get more practice with different problems.
- I took a look at one of the pages done by one of my friends in this class that she did for this assignment, and I think either she went really overboard, or I went not hard enough for this assignment! It's really well done and I want to strive to be that good someday with my code.
