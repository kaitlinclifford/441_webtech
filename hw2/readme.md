# This Weeks Homework

1. For this weeks homework cycle, I felt it to be really easy to understand and create all of the consol logs that I needed.
2. In order to complete the assignment I followed the links, and followed along with the video after I had made my code to see if I had done it correctly.
3. I didn't really have any problems this week. I made my code on Tuesday, but wanted to wait to post it until after the video on Wednesday came out so I could watch to make sure I did it right.
4.  I felt like I understood most of the terminology that was being talked about, so it was easy enough for me to follow along without getting lost.
5. I didn't help anyone this week with issues because there was no one who had issues that I saw.

## Additional Info

- I had a good time using the Code Academy. It was nice to be able to put in the code and actually see if I had done something right or wrong and have it tell me right away if I had messed up or not!
- I'm also going to take a look at Grasshopper to see what that's about and hopefully it'll be a good tool.
