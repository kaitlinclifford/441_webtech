# This Weeks Homework

1. For this weeks homework cycle, it was a rough one. I watched the videos about 3 times and still didn't really understand why there were soooooo many different files in the example file. Working through the files I was able to figure out mostly what went where and how each part fit together, but I honestly don't know if I could do this by myself if I wasn't given an example file to use. It was also especially hard because of spring break because I forgot to do it until the last minute.
2. I don't know how well the rest of the semester is going to go. Each week it seems to get exponentially harder and I'm having trouble keeping up to the best of my abilities. I will keep trying to learn more and more so I can understand everything being brought to me, but I still find it hard.
3. Problems were high this week, but I tried my best to work them out. Wish I could've made a better assignment, but I did the best I could for this assignment.
4. I want to be able to make better assignments by the end of the semester! Honestly that would make me super happy.
5. I didn't help anyone with problems because no one had any problems. I mainly was dealing with my own problems so I needed to just focus on my own stuff.

# Additional Info
- alright so I feel like I have everything right with this assignment, but for some reason, I can't make my json file work with my other files. I've looked at others assignments and I'm trying what they have in the json file, but I can't make it work.
- I keep trying to debugg it, but I can't figure it out.
