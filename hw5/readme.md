# This Weeks Homework

1. For this weeks homework cycle, I thought the concept was cool. I really enjoy the idea of being able to make my own sort of game through code and have it work. Even though this week is only the beginning of the game, I'm really excited for next week in order to finish the game.
2. In order to complete the assignment I watched all of the videos, and even rewatched the example video in order to go through my example and see what I was doing wrong. I also went onto Grasshopper which I thought helped me understand arrays better.
3. I thought the problems were at a minimum this week. I did have a problem for a bit where none of my pictures were working, but I realized I messed up in the while() part, so the pictures stopped working, and then sometimes the page wouldn't even load. But I was going line by line, debugging it in order to see my messup!
4. I felt like this weeks assignment was easy to understand. The only thing I don't really understand was the createRandomImageArray... that part was the main reason why I had to rewatch the example video. After watching it the second time I understood it a bit better and was able to figure out my homework, but I'm not sure I could do that by myself.
5. I didn't help anyone this week with issues and I didn't post any issues. But I want to start meeting with my group more. We haven't been able to meet lately because we've all been super busy.

## Additional Info

- Grasshopper is still going well! Really enjoying it.
- Wasn't sure how many images I was supposed to put for this assignment, so I only did 5 images to make it 10 total images to match together.
- My link down below keeps sending it back to the readme instead of my actual site :(
