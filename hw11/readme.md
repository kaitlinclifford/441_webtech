# This Weeks Homework

1. For this weeks homework cycle, it was a pretty alright one. Wasn't too bad, but I know I could've done better. I've spent the last week preparing for a "expo" of sorts for my interactive media class so it was hard to focus alot on this homework. I'm excited though to get moving on my final project!
2. This week's content was easy to understand, but putting everything together was a bit difficult for me:/ once I figured it out though, I was really happy with the result.
3. My main problem this week was figuring out how to make the blocks disappear when I went next to them. Then finally I figured it out and it made me super happy.
4. I want to be able to make better assignments by the end of the semester!
5. I tried to help someone with a problem they had, but I don't know if it worked or not because they never answered me back so oh well.

# Additional Info
- I'm pretty happy with how this assignment turned out! Now I'm excited to get the final rolling!!!
