# This Weeks Homework

1. For this weeks homework cycle, it was a rough one again. I went through each section and tried to do each part myself, but some of them wouldn't work for me and I couldn't figure out why. I don't think I really like where I have to just do everything for myself because I didn't know how to fix things when they didn't work for me. I'm more of a visual learner, and it's nice to watch videos that go through all of the examples and show me what's possible because I can know how to do something right, but then I can also take that info into atom and try it for myself to see if it'll work for me or not, and how I can change it based on what was being taught.
2. This week seemed better overall for content and my understanding of where everything went in the index and scripts. However, it was still super difficult for me. I wanted to add another block that would move independently from the other 2 blocks that were in there, but I couldn't figure out the specifics about making the block move.
3. My main problem this week was not being able to make the 3rd block I made actually move. I mean, I had other problems but the main one was I couldn't figure out how to make the newest block move. I tried coding different things to try but nothing worked. So instead of the block moving, it's just chilling in the middle of the canvas. And it's not even the block I wanted to have move. In my code, the 3rd block is moving, instead of the second. I understand that it's because code looks at the stuff at the end and executes that part, but still, I couldn't figure out how to make the other block I made move.
4. I want to be able to make better assignments by the end of the semester! Honestly that would make me super happy.
5. I didn't help anyone with problems because no one had any problems. I mainly was dealing with my own problems so I needed to just focus on my own stuff.

# Additional Info
- coding is very confusing sometimes haha
