# This Weeks Homework

1. Alright! This is my final project! I created a Kpop website of sorts. I wanted to put 6 of the most popular kpop groups right now on a page and let people click on different ones and go to the page and see what they look like and learn about their roles in each group! I honestly had so much fun creating this site. Probably will be using this as an example of my work that I've made because I'm really proud of it.
2. I really like going to other people's sites and being able to see the work that they've not only done the whole semester, but for the final as well. I was really inspired by Christoff because his site with the Avatar stuff was AMAZING. He was able to successfully get a drop down menu, and I will look into how he did that so maybe I could put that into mine too!!
3. I did have a few problems along the way, but I was mostly able to figure them out. The only REAL problem I had was with the drop down menu. To be honest, the dropdown menu was a late addition to what I might be able to add to my site to make it better, and if it didn't work I was going to be fine with not having it. But I did get it to work 75% of the way, so I'm alright with that for now. I couldn't figure out how to move them into a different spot than what they are right now, so I just left it. Also, since I couldn't make them go to a certain position, I decided to only have the drop down menu on the front page, but maybe next semester I will be able to ask for help again and get it figured out so I can be 100% happy with it! Right now I'm only 98%, but I still love it.
4. OMG!!!!! This assignment surprisingly only took me around a whole week to do, (since I had finals and the expo etc.) but I really enjoyed every moment I spent working on this final. Honestly super proud at how it turned out, even if it wasn't 100% everything I wanted!
5. I was glad that I came into your office to get help because it honestly really helped me with figuring out things with my project. You're very easy to talk to and make coding easy to understand. And I really loved when you explained about the ../ to get out of one folder into another, because I never fully understood why people would sometimes just have ./ or ../ or just the words.

# Additional Info
- I'm pretty happy with how the final turned out! Honestly really happy that I could create something that I find really cool, and put information in it that I'm passionate about.
- And thank you so much again for your help... It might not have seemed like a lot, but it kept the project rolling along which really helped me!!
