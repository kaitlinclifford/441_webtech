<!-- I put this one that is taken from the index because I thought
that maybe I could just use BTS in the middle, then have people scroll down
to learn more info about them. Idk if that would work but it was a good
idea at the time. just would have to take away the link on their name, and
insert some pictures, and make it less ugly with the things at the bottom
of the screen --about, career internship-- ALSO wanted to leave the home,
boygroups, girlgroups at the top so people could go back... also wanted to
potentially instert something like christoffs where he put a drop down menu
where it could take people to the other groups... idk how hard that would
be but i wanted to try.  -->
