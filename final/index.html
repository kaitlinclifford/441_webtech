      <div class="about">
        <p>Korean culture is becoming very popular around the world,
          <br>not just in Korea. It's called Hallyu, the Korean Wave. This
          <br>includes Korean Dramas, Korean food, as well as cosmetics.
          <br>And at the heart of Hallyu is the ever-growing popularity of K-pop.
          <br>K-pop has become a truly global phenomenon thanks to its distinctive
          <br>blend of addictive melodies, slick choreography and production values,
          <br>and an endless parade of attractive South Korean performers who spend
          <br>years in grueling studio systems learning to sing and dance in synchronized perfection.

      <div class="career">
        <p>For many people, Kpop is a way of life and they can get really into
          <br>a group or singer, and can become part of that group's fandom. Each
          <br>group has their own fandom, and their own fandom name. BTS's fandom is
          <br>A.R.M.Y. while BlackPink's are named blinks. Along with their fandom,
          <br>each group also has their own lightstick that fans can bring to the concerts.</p>
