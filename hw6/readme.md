# This Weeks Homework

1. For this weeks homework cycle, I started out strong. I had so many ideas in my head about how I could accomplish every task and make a really nice game! However, when it came time to do the actual coding, I had a very hard time!!
2. In order to complete the assignment I watched all of the videos, and then asked help from people in my study group. They were able to help me through my problems and vice versa.
3. I thought the problems were at an ultimate high this week. I especially had trouble with getting all of the info to come out onto the last page! I was able to look at other people's code and that really helped me. I realized I was on the right track, but I just didn't take it as far as it needed to go.
4. I felt like this weeks assignment was easy to understand. There wasn't that much to be asked of us. The getting it done on the other hand was the tricky part!
5. I actually helped a couple people with their problems on the issues board. They had similar problems that I did, and it was nice to give some good feedback to help!

## Additional Info

- Grasshopper is still going well! Really enjoying it.
- On the last page, I couldn't make the score come up for the life of me. I think all of my code it right, but I can't figure out why it's not working. At one point I had "score: undefined" instead of nothing, but now it's just nothing.
