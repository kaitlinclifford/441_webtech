# This Weeks Homework

1. For this weeks homework cycle, it really was a refresher for me with using CSS. I haven't taken a coding class in about a year, so I was fairly surprised with how much I remembered. I felt that the information being asked for this first assignment was a reasonable amount of work because most of us should know at least a little bit of CSS still.
2. In order to complete the assignment I followed the links, and looked at the example sites in order to know what I could do to my site. Having the example site was **VERY** helpful because it allowed me to look at the index and change things in order to try out new ideas, or even see where I was going wrong with my code and how I could change it to actually work.
3. I did have some problems at first. After watching both of the class videos, I thought I had it down in how I could start to create the site. When it got time to actually creating it, I totally blanked on what to do. Having the example code helped me, but I still had issues with my site when trying to set it up correctly. For some reason I couldn't figure out the background image part, so I went to the issues board, and they were able to help me by telling me about the ../ infront of images!
4.  If I had other questions I looked them up on Google, and if the answer wasn't there, I went to the w3schools website, and they were able to help me figure out other mistakes I was making. I've remebered a lot of terms in this lesson, but I feel like it would be helpful to keep talking about them so I don't forget or misunderstand what they are.
5. I wasn't able to help anyone this homework cycle, only because the other people asked questions towards the end, when I was at work, so I couldn't answer them back. But I would still like to be able to help others in the future though.

## Additional Info

- This class seems like it will be a little bit of a challenge for me. I will do my best at keeping up and answering others questions
- I'm starting a study group to help each other with coding so I'm excited about that!
- Even though I know I'm not good at coding, I always find it really satisfying when I can make an actual site come to life so I want to try and get better!
